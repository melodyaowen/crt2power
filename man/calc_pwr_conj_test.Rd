\description{
Allows user to calculate the statistical power of a cluster-randomized trial with two co-primary outcomes given a set of study design input values, including the number of clusters in each trial arm, and cluster size. Uses the conjunctive intersection-union test approach. Code is adapted from "calPower_ttestIU()" from https://github.com/siyunyang/coprimary_CRT written by Siyun Yang.
